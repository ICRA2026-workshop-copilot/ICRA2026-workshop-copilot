## Overview

**Robot Copilots** aim to combine abilities of robots and teleoperators, progressly collaborate with humans more effectively and extending human oversight from direct teleoperation to flexible, scalable supervision across multiple robots and tasks. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners exploring **human‑in‑the‑loop systems** spanning manipulation, mobile platforms, and humanoids—from **teleoperation and shared control interfaces** (VR/AR, haptics, exoskeletons) and **copilot triggering mechanisms** (uncertainty estimation, anomaly/OOD detection, runtime safety monitors) to **learning frameworks** (preference feedback, corrective demonstrations, RLHF, IL/RL) and the integration of **large VLA and diffusion/flow‑based policies** for embodied AI.

Our goal is to articulate **principled copilot architectures** and share **practical lessons** for building *reliable, scalable* robot systems in the open world.

## Topics (include, but not limited to)
- Copilot system design for **teleoperation, shared control, and scalable supervision** (1→N)
- **Triggering intervention**: uncertainty estimation, OOD/error detection, and runtime safety monitors
- **Human feedback and guidance**: corrective demonstrations, preference learning, RLHF, IL/RL
- Human‑robot interfaces: **VR/AR**, haptics, exoskeletons, handheld/UMI controllers
- **Learning‑centric data engines**: logging, synchronization, and **dataset curation & selection** (active/submodular)
- Policy learning: **VLA**, diffusion/flow‑matching policies, residual and hybrid control
- **Fleet‑level learning and supervision**: scheduling, safety guarding, task routing, evaluation at scale
- Applications: household/service robotics, industrial co‑bots, dexterous manipulation, and humanoid skills

## Call for Papers
We welcome **non‑archival extended abstracts** presenting early results, position papers, demos, or negative/lessons‑learned studies. Submissions are intended to **foster community exchange** and **do not** appear in IEEE Xplore.

**Suggested format** (final template to be posted):
- **2–4 pages** (excluding references), single‑blind (author names visible)
- PDF, IEEE conference style (template link forthcoming)
- Optional: **appendix** for details; **video (≤3 min)** for demos

**Review**: light single‑blind review by the workshop PC. Accepted papers will be presented as **posters** and a subset as **spotlight talks**. We plan to host all accepted PDFs and talk slides on this website.

**Submission site**: TBA (OpenReview or CMT).
