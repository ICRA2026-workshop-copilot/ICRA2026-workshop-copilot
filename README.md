## Overview

**Robot Copilots** aim to make robots *know when to ask for help* and *scale human supervision* from **1:1 teleoperation** to **1:N fleet oversight**. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners working on **humanâ€‘inâ€‘theâ€‘loop systems** across manipulation, mobile manipulation, and humanoidsâ€”from **teleoperation interfaces** (VR/AR/haptics/exoskeletons) and **copilot triggering** (uncertainty, anomaly/OOD detection, safety monitors) to **data pipelines** (rewindâ€‘andâ€‘refine, preference feedback, active learning) and **large VLA/diffusion policies** for embodied AI.

Our goal is to articulate **principled copilot architectures** and share **practical lessons** for building *reliable, scalable* robot systems in the open world.

---

## Topics (include, but not limited to)
- Copilot system design for **teleoperation & supervision at scale** (1â†’N)
- **Triggering intervention**: uncertainty, OOD/error detection, runtime monitors
- **Rewindâ€‘andâ€‘refine**, corrective demonstrations, preference learning, RLHF/DPO
- Humanâ€‘robot interfaces: **VR/AR**, haptics, exoskeletons, handheld/UMI controllers
- **Lowâ€‘latency comms** & middleware (ROSÂ 2, WebRTC, Zenoh) for remote operation
- Data engines: logging, synchronization, **dataset curation & selection** (active/submodular)
- Policy learning: **VLA**, diffusion/flowâ€‘matching policies, residual & hybrid control
- **Fleet learning**: scheduling, safety guarding, task routing, evaluation at scale
- Applications: household/service, industrial/coâ€‘bots, dexterous and humanoid skills

## Call for Papers
We welcome **nonâ€‘archival extended abstracts** presenting early results, position papers, demos, or negative/lessonsâ€‘learned studies. Submissions are intended to **foster community exchange** and **do not** appear in IEEE Xplore.

**Suggested format** (final template to be posted):
- **2â€“4 pages** (excluding references), singleâ€‘blind (author names visible)
- PDF, IEEE conference style (template link forthcoming)
- Optional: **appendix** for details; **video (â‰¤3Â min)** for demos

**Review**: light singleâ€‘blind review by the workshop PC. Accepted papers will be presented as **posters** and a subset as **spotlight talks**. We plan to host all accepted PDFs and talk slides on this website.

**Submission site**: TBA (OpenReview or CMT).  
**Contact for submissions**: see below.

## Code of Conduct & Inclusion
This workshop adheres to the **IEEE RAS Code of Conduct** and the ICRA W/T guidelines. We actively encourage participation from researchers at all career stages and will prioritize **diversity and inclusion** in invited talks and the program committee.
